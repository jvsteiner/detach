## What is Detach?

Detach is a native macOS utility that helps you **reclaim storage space** by cleaning up old iMessage attachments. Over time, photos, videos, and files shared through Messages can accumulate **gigabytes of hidden storage** in `~/Library/Messages/Attachments/`. Detach makes it easy to find, review, and safely delete these files.

### üéØ Perfect For:
- **Photographers** sharing high-resolution images
- **Content creators** sending large video files  
- **Professionals** exchanging documents and presentations
- **Anyone** running low on Mac storage space

## ‚ú® Features

### üîç **Smart Scanning**
- Automatically discovers all iMessage attachments
- Organizes files by UUID folders (how macOS stores them)
- Shows total size and file count for each attachment group

### üìä **Flexible Filtering**
- **Time-based filtering**: Find files older than custom periods
  - Days, months, or years
  - Examples: "3 months", "180 days", "2 years"
- **Size-based filtering**: Target large files wasting space
  - Custom sizes with KB/MB/GB units
  - Examples: "50 MB+", "2.5 GB+", "500 KB+"
- **File type filtering**: Focus on specific content
  - Images, videos, audio, documents, plugin data

### üóÇÔ∏è **Bulk Management**
- Select individual files or entire categories
- Preview file locations in Finder before deleting
- Safe deletion (files moved to Trash, recoverable)
- Real-time storage savings calculation

### üîê **Privacy & Security**
- **100% offline** - no internet connection required
